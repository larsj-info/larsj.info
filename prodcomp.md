# Supermarket Calculator
This app aims to make it very easy to compare prices of similar products when weights/volumes/number-of-items are different and also when different "offers" apply to some and not others.

It is designed to be simple to use requiring only one hand and a thumb (or single finger) to use and has different layouts for right and left handed users. It is also colour-blind friendly.

You can use it in-store when out shopping to compare products or online to compare products from the same or different websites.

It is built to be language independent and supports English and Welsh at the moment. It should be easily translatable to any European language and if you are interested to help with that then please contact us via the "Feedback" setting in the app.
