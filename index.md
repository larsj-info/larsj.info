You should find that you don’t need any paper forms to play using the app as it tracks everything you would mark on a form, and you can see that data any time on the left-hand scroll panel on the screen.

## Headline Limitations:
- No YB40 bomber option.
- B-24J crew assignment option defaults to Radio Operator as Left Waist Gunner, Left Waist Gunner as Nose Turret Gunner and Navigator at Radio Operator seat (later release will allow you to choose from the two options).
- No optional rules other than the Gunnery Review Board, rule 10.5.3 for B17G Radio Room gun and Bomber Group as per rule 10.4.
- Escort effect randomly removes the attackers rather than you choose which one(s) to remove
- If available “Lady Luck Smiles” is automatically used by the app to try and avoid catastrophic events.
- No penalty crew moving
- No Tables 5-7B or 5-17C
- The app needs to be used in Landscape mode.
Anything shown inside the blue-bordered rectangles is potentially scrollable so if the text you see goes close to the bottom of the rectangle, make sure that you scroll down to see everything (this can include guns that can fire at the enemy).

There is a main menu in the top left corner of the screen from which you can choose at any time. It now has the following options:

## Settings
This will display all the options available on a new settings screen. There you can choose from the following options:
- Preferred Random Number Strategy
Which one of 3 different random number strategies to use for the dice rolling.
- Show more game details
If you want to see the results of the table lookups and what the die roll modifications are then you can toggle the detail pages on (but this will mean a lot more button pressing ;-)
This will also let you see a lot more information about damage to fighters from defensive fire.
- Show Bomber Group information
Disable this option if you don’t want to see the various bomber group game details as described in section 10.4 of the rules.
- Always show campaign choice before next mission
This will allow you to swap to another campaign at the end of the current mission.
If you choose "City" then make sure you set the mission date first on the next screen as that will then determine what bomber choices you have (if a new bomber is needed) and that date will also determine which campaign number is used for the various combat tables.
- Use your own crew names
If you don’t want to type in your crew names the app defaults to the random crew names as posted by worst2first on BGG Files for TFT. Turn this on if you want to enter your own crew names.
- Use your own plane name
If you don’t want to make up your plane name the app defaults to the random plane names as posted by worst2first on BGG Files for TFT. Turn this on if you want to enter your own plane names.
- Campaign over if pilot KIA/MIA/POW or sent home
Your current campaign will only last as long as the pilot. If you want to continue the campaign with other surviving crew members if the pilot is lost, then you should unset this option
- Pilot gets new crew after more than 6 weeks absence
If the pilot needs 6+ weeks to recover from any injuries then he will get a new crew for the next mission date on his recovery date. If you want to continue with the same crew then unset this option.

## Show more details
This option will immediately show you the detailed information behind whatever has just been displayed. This is the same information that would be displayed before the current screen if you have the “Show more game details” option on except that now you can do it on demand rather than having it happen for every screen update.

## Show crew details
This option will immediately show you the information for all crew members.
Currently that information will be reset after you press “Submit” on the next mission screen so you can see any wound/frostbite details up to that point.

## Composite Mission Log
This option will immediately show you the Composite Mission Log (CML) Summary screen. A mission gets added to the Composite Mission Log when the “Next Mission” button is shown on the right-hand side of the screen.
For each summary entry, the mission number is a button that will take you to a mission detail screen for that mission where you can see the full target info and who the crew were on that mission.
The “share” button at the top right of this screen will let you export the CML details to a CSV file so that you can import it into apps like Excel. It has (only) been tested for Google Drive on Android and for iCloud on iOS/iPadOS.

## Bomber Group Status
This will show the current state of the whole bomber group with damage in amber or red and your plane shown in blue text.
At end of mission, it will show which bombers landed OK, were destroyed (KIA) or failed to make it back to base (MIA).
